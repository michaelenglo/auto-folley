838
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:03,373
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

839
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,964
Is your name Matthew? I want some action.

840
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:12,924
Officer...

841
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:17,887
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

842
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,598
You gonna bust me for nothing, man?

843
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:22,308
I'm not a cop.

844
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:26,104
- I ain't no cop.
- Then why ask me for action?

845
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:30,149
Because she sent me over.

846
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,405
I suppose that ain't a.38
you got in your sock.

847
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,574
.38? No.

848
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:40,326
I'm clean, man.

849
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,205
- Shit. You're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

850
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:46,082
That's nice.

851
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,754
It's all right.
$15, 15 minutes. $25, half an hour.

852
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:54,632
Shit.

853
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:56,968
Cowboy, huh?

854
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:02,557
I once had a horse in Coney Island.
She got hit by a car.

855
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,103
Take it or leave it.

856
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:10,648
If you wanna save yourself some money,
don't fuck her.

857
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:12,609
'Cause you'll be back every night
for more.

858
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:16,863
She's twelve-and-a-half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

859
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:18,865
You can do anything with her...

860
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:22,660
come on her, fuck her in the mouth,
fuck her in the ass, come on her face.

861
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:25,747
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

862
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,627
But no rough stuff. All right?

863
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,259
All right, I'll take it.

864
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:41,137
Hey, man! Take out no money over here.

865
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:43,389
You gonna fuck me?

866
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:46,518
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

867
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,021
Catch you later, copper.

868
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,733
- What did you say?
- See you later, copper.

869
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,111
I'm no cop, man.

870
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,865
If you are, it's entrapment already.

871
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:06,037
I'm hip.

872
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,957
Buddy, you don't look hip.

873
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:15,421
Go ahead, have yourself a good time.

874
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,140
You're a funny guy.

875
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:31,479
But looks aren't everything.
